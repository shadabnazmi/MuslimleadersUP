# MuslimleadersUP

The classification of Muslim and Non-Muslim candidates have been identified as 1 and 0.
The classification has been done looking at their names and after cross checking each candidate by google search. Once the name matched the constituency, religion of the candidate was established.
The summary (so that you don't have to analyse) is under a CSV as 'UP political representation of muslims.csv' in the repository.

Source: All candidates' data from ECI and Association for Democratic Reforms.
